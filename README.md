### This project is something that I started working on through a Codecademy tutorial. The project focused on a single run of the game and the run only used one word. After finishing the project, I decided to expand on it a good bit. I included more words for the game to use, and I also made use of a random generator to randomly choose from those words. I also made the game easily re-runnable using a string input at the end of the program.
